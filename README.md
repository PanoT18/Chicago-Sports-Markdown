## Why Chicago Sports Matter

> Chicago isn’t just a _sports city_, it’s a **sports melting pot**, with some of the best players from any major sport to ever play the game. 
> Fans in Chicago are die-hard, and I genuinely believe that when the sports are good, the city becomes better, and so do the people.
